					David was born and raised in Lancaster in the North West of England. Starting on the clarinet at age 7, then picking up saxophone at age 13, David has been heavily involved in music-making for most of his life. Studying under Paul Froggatt, he achieved his Grade 8 and an ALCM diploma before age 18, and similarly, under Gail Merrilees his ARSM in clarinet. Whilst at school, David played Lead Alto with the Lancashire Youth Jazz Orchestra for 3 years, and was a regular member of the Northern All-Stars Big Band in Torrisholme. David currently attends the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he is in his fourth and final year of undergraduate studies. <br>David's musical influences are numerous, drawing on the jazz styles of Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt and Cannonball Adderly, as well as contemporary ensembles such as Lydian Collective, Huntertones and non-jazz influences, including Bon Iver, Novo Amor and √Åsgeir.
